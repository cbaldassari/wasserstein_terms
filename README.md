## Reproducing the results

The provided Python [notebook](https://github.com/cbaldassari/wasserstein_terms/blob/main/wasstax.ipynb) contains the code that implements the  method of Wasserstein Barycenter' distribution calculation, in particular with the GMM initialization technique that is explained in depth in our other papers/repositories: ../cbaldassari/gmm_init, ../cbaldassari/gmm_embedding_init, ../cbaldassari/time_series_network. Further more you can find the code to implement the optimization in the file
